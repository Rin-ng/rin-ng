About Me:
Hi, My name is Airin Ng.
I created a fun personal portfolio because I planned on upgrading it with lots of JS after learning more about it.
As such, this was intentionally created to be somewhat funny and a little bit silly instead of all serious.
I had a lot of fun making it, and hoped you find the contents amusing!
